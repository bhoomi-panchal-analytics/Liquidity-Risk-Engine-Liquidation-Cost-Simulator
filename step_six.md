Now we move to the professional upgrade:

### **SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS + STRESS SCENARIOS**

Right now your model computes one liquidation path.


**Real risk management requires:**

• Cost vs Participation Rate

• Cost vs Liquidation Horizon

• Stress regime simulation

This transforms your project from “execution calculator” into “liquidity risk engine”.



## **STEP 6: Sensitivity Analysis Module**

**Create new file:**

src/sensitivity.py



**Objectives:**

Compute total cost for different participation rates

Compute total cost for different liquidation horizons

Allow stress multipliers on volatility and ADV
